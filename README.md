## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- OpenAI API key
- OpenSSL (for generating development certificates)

### Installation

1. **Clone or download the project files**

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp config.env.template .env
   ```
   
   Edit `.env` and add your OpenAI API key:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```

4. **Generate SSL certificates for development**
   ```bash
   npm run generate-certs
   ```

5. **Start the server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   
   For development with auto-reload:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. **Access the application**
   - Open your browser to `https://localhost:3443`
   - You may see a security warning for the self-signed certificate - this is normal for development

## üìñ Usage

1. **Paste Email Content**: Copy and paste the body of an email containing event information into the text area
2. **Extract Event**: Click the "Generate Calendar Event" button to process the content
3. **Review Details**: The extracted event information will be displayed
4. **Download ICS**: Click the download button to get your `.ics` calendar file
5. **Import to Calendar**: Open the downloaded file with your preferred calendar application

### Supported Input Types

The application accepts multiple input formats:

#### **üìß Rich Content (HTML/Images)**
- Paste directly from email clients (Outlook, Gmail, Apple Mail)
- Preserves formatting, links, and embedded images
- Best for modern email content

#### **üìù Plain Text**
- Simple text input for basic emails
- Fastest processing method
- Good for large content

#### **üìé File Upload**
- **.pdf** - PDF documents (great for printed emails or email attachments)
- **.eml** - Email files from most email clients
- **.msg** - Outlook email files
- **.txt** - Plain text files
- **.html** - HTML email files

### Example Content

The application works best with emails containing:
- Meeting invitations
- Event announcements with dates and times
- Conference or webinar details
- Appointment confirmations
- PDF documents with event information

```

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Your OpenAI API key (required) | - |
| `PORT` | Server port | 3443 |
| `NODE_ENV` | Environment (development/production) | development |
| `FRONTEND_URL` | Frontend URL for CORS | https://localhost:3443 |
| `SSL_PRIVATE_KEY` | Path to SSL private key (production) | - |
| `SSL_CERTIFICATE` | Path to SSL certificate (production) | - |
| `SSL_CA` | Path to SSL CA bundle (production) | - |

### Rate Limiting

The application includes rate limiting to prevent abuse:
- **Window**: 15 minutes
- **Limit**: 10 requests per IP address
- **Response**: HTTP 429 when limit exceeded

## üèóÔ∏è Production Deployment

### 1. SSL Certificates

For production, replace the self-signed certificates with proper SSL certificates:

```bash
# Let's Encrypt example
sudo certbot --nginx -d yourdomain.com
```

Update your `.env` file with the certificate paths:
```
SSL_PRIVATE_KEY=/etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/privkey.pem
SSL_CERTIFICATE=/etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/fullchain.pem
```

### 2. Environment Setup

```bash
export NODE_ENV=production
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_production_api_key
export PORT=443
```

### 3. Process Management

Use a process manager like PM2:

```bash
npm install -g pm2
pm2 start server.js --name email-calendar-extractor
pm2 startup
pm2 save
```

### 4. Reverse Proxy (Optional)

Use nginx as a reverse proxy for additional security and performance:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name yourdomain.com;
    return 301 https://$server_name$request_uri;
}

server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name yourdomain.com;
    
    ssl_certificate /path/to/certificate.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /path/to/private-key.pem;
    
    location / {
        proxy_pass https://localhost:3443;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

## üîí Security Considerations

### Input Validation
- All inputs are validated on both client and server side
- Character limits enforced (10-50,000 characters)
- HTML escaping prevents XSS attacks
- Express-validator used for robust validation

### Data Privacy
- Email content is processed in memory only
- No permanent storage of user data
- OpenAI API calls follow their data usage policies
- Rate limiting prevents enumeration attacks

### HTTPS/SSL
- All communications encrypted
- HSTS headers enforced
- Secure cookie settings
- CSP headers implemented

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"OpenAI API key not configured"**
- Ensure your `.env` file contains `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- Verify the API key is valid and has sufficient credits

**"SSL certificates not found"**
- Run `npm run generate-certs` to create development certificates
- Check that the `certs/` directory exists with `key.pem` and `cert.pem`

**"No calendar event information found"**
- Ensure the email contains clear date/time information
- Try rephrasing or adding more context to the email content
- Check that the content is not too sparse or ambiguous

**Rate limiting errors**
- Wait 15 minutes before trying again
- Consider adjusting rate limits in `server.js` for development

**PDF processing issues**
- Ensure PDF contains selectable text (not just images)
- Password-protected PDFs are not supported
- Large PDFs may take longer to process
- For image-based PDFs, use OCR software first to convert to text

### Development Tips

1. **Testing with various email formats**: Try different email styles and formats
2. **Monitoring OpenAI usage**: Keep track of your API usage and costs
3. **Browser console**: Check for JavaScript errors in the browser console
4. **Server logs**: Monitor the server console for detailed error information
